https://db.rstudio.com/rstudio/connections/

### Prerequisites

These are the steps you will need to follow

1. Install PostgreSQL on your system. You can find the necessary files [here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
2. Install pgAdmin on your system (optional). You can find the necessary files [here](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
3. Install latest version of Microsoft PowerShell (which includes a ssh client). You can find the necessary files [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell)
  
You will now setup the connection to the server with the data. You will need to have Compute Canada credentials and a SSH client (included with PowerShell).

### Connecting to CC database

In order to access the CC database and work locally with the data, you will need to open a SSH tunnel that will map the remote database to a local address on your computer (more details can be found on [CC Wiki](https://docs.alliancecan.ca/wiki/SSH_tunnelling)). From a PowerShell or another Shell on UNIX flavored OSes, create the SSH tunnel:

```sh
ssh -L 5433:cedar-pgsql-vm.int.cedar.computecanada.ca:5432 <YOUR_CC_USERNAME>@cedar.computecanada.ca 
```

This will let you access the CC database cluster from your computer at the address `localhost:5433`. (You can use another port instead of `5433` if this one is already in use.)

Once the SSH tunnel created, you can access the `interact_db` target database using standard clients from your computer, _e.g._ `psql` or pgAdmin. For instance:

```sh
psql -U <YOUR_CC_USERNAME> -h localhost -p 5433 interact_db
```

Note that once the SSH tunnel has been established, you will no longer have to provide your password, nor save it somewhere in your script as all users logged on CC are automatically authenticated on the database cluster.

This method allows to retrieve the latest version of the survey datasets (corresponding Github hash indicated in the schema's comments/description, see below), while avoiding to store any data on the local drive _as long as you don't save the RData environment when closing R/Rstudio_.

#### Listing the data available

Interact surveys are stored under three schemas (_i.e._ DB equivalent of folders, see [definition](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/glossary.html#GLOSSARY-SCHEMA)) named `tk_survey`, `tk_survey2` and `tk_survey3`:

```
interact_db=>\dn+ tk_survey*
                                   List of schemas
    Name    |                                 Description
------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------
 tk_survey  | Stores wave 1 survey data from Treksoft as well as reformatting views
 tk_survey2 | Stores wave 2 survey data from Treksoft as well as reformatting views
 tk_survey3 | Stores wave 3 survey data from Treksoft as well as reformatting views
(3 rows)
```

Within each schema, data is organized in materialized views (see [definition](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/glossary.html#GLOSSARY-MATERIALIZED-VIEW)) with names expressing the survey type (`eligibility`, `health`, `veritas`), the city (`mtl`, `skt`, `van`, `vic`) prefixed with the wave number and the subcategory of data extracted from the survey (`main` or other subcategories, depending on the survey type). From wave 2 on, returning and new participants have separate materialized views, with a `new` suffix appended to names of materialized views of new participants.

To illustrate the naming convention above, here are a few examples of materialized views and their explanation (note that materialized views need to be prefixed with the schema they belong to):

- `tk_survey2.eligibility_2mtl_main`: Eligibility questionnaire for returning participants in Montréal, wave 2
- `tk_survey2.eligibility_2mtlnew_main`: Eligibility questionnaire for new participants in Montréal, wave 2
- `tk_survey2.veritas_2skt_location`: Locations (points) extracted from the VERITAS questionnaire of returning participants in Saskatoon, wave 2
- `tk_survey2.health_2vicnew_main`: Health questionnaire for new participants in Victoria, wave 2

### Getting the data

In order to access the Interact data from _R_, you will need to install the following libraries:

```r
library(DBI)
library(RPostgres) 
```    

Then, to access the database, you need to create a connection object in R:

```r
con <- dbConnect(Postgres(), host="localhost", port=5433, user = "<YOUR_CC_USERNAME>", dbname = "interact_db")
```

Then, using the `con` object, it is possible to get the data from one materialized view, for instance:

```r
elig2mtl <- dbReadTable(con, Id(schema = "tk_survey2", table = "eligibility_2mtl_main"))
```

It is also possible to carve your own query:

```r
age2mtl <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT interact_id, age FROM tk_survey2.health_2mtl_main UNION SELECT interact_id, age FROM tk_survey2.health_2mtlnew_main")
```

When working in R Markdown, it is possible to leverage the multiple code languages recognized by Rmd to directly retrieve data from the database using SQL queries and have the resulting data stored in a DataFrame:

````{verbatim}
```{sql, connection=con, output.var="health1mtl"}
SELECT * FROM tk_survey.health_1mtl_main
```
````
